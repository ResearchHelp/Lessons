// if you want to make a specific addition in this repo, send it to me as text to ResearchHelpHedgehog@gmail.com (do not send me an attachment because I won't open it) Thanks!

// note, I use .pdf files so that you can see the documents I've uploaded without having to download them   
// also I upload .docx files (Microsoft Word) of the same documents

// if you see just_a_file.txt, don't worry about it; those files just exist to keep folders when I make updates
