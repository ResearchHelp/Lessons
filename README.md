2) paste the document as text to ResearchHelpHedgehog@gmail.com (do not send me an attachment because I won't open it)     
3) tell me why you think this document should go in this repo (and how the document has helped your research, if it has)     
4) tell me whether or not you wish to be "cited" in your document (if it gets published). If yes, how, specifically.

# Extra notes
// note, I use .pdf files so that you can see the documents I've uploaded without having to download them   
// also I upload .docx files (Microsoft Word) of the same documents

// if you see just_a_file.txt, don't worry about it; those files just exist to keep folders when I make updates
